Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
  
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer: Imports the module TurtleWorld
		Defines the specific "world" and turtle being used 


These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: (Turtle, distance, n) = (string, float, int)

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: fd and lt = 

		fd(Turtle, distance)
		lt(Turtle, angle)

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: Not sure how to set up polyline function. 
	
Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: fd(Turtle, radius)

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:	fd(Turtle, radius)
		circle(Turtle, radius)
		bk(Turtle, radius)

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: postcondition
